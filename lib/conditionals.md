# What is a conditional?

I've learned about conditionals in the context of logic.  Conditionals, as I used to experience them, were "if" statements, where the conditional if suggests that something will happen/come to pass/ be true if there were certain conditions
or parts that come true or are assumed.  They are used to suggest that the presence of certain facts or criteria will bring about or cause some other event to happen or fact to be true.  The notion is that if the antecedent (the first half
of the conditional) is not met, the second half will not be met (at least not by those means).

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

So, I know that in Python, the only programming language that I am familiar with to some degree, the single '=' is used to assign values to symbols, like when you say x = 5.  The double equal sign, '==' is used to denote equality, as in "is equal to",
which is somewhat funny in the sense that in normal parliance, the single equal sign is used to mean that.  From what I can tell, the symbols operate similarly in Ruby (and in most coding languages, I imagine!).
