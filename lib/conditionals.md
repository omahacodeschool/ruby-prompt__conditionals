# What is a conditional?

A conditional statement evalutes to true or false. Examples are If/else statement, case statement and loops. They ask a question and if true they executed the code along with it, if false it moves one to the next condition. 

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

'=' is an assignment. It takes the value on right side and applies it to the variable the left side.

'==' is a question. It asks whether or not the value on the right equal to the thing on the value.
