# What is a conditional?

A conditional is a command that depends upon the result of another command to be run, ex. when, if, elsif, else, unless, etc.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

Replace me with your response...
'=' is an assignment operator that assigns values from right side operands to the left side operand. '==' is a comparison operator that checks whether the value of two operands are equal. If they are, the condition becomes true.
