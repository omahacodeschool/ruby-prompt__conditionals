# What is a conditional?

A conditional uses the statements 'if', 'elsif' and 'else' to move the otherwise linear progression of a program in an alternative direction based on the true-ness or false-ness of the conditional statement. 

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

'=' is used to define a variable. '==' is used to check for equality.
