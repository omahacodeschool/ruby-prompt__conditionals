# What is a conditional?

A conditional is an element that controls the flow of the code. A conditional evaluates a given expression to be true or false. If true, the code following the conditional statement will continue to run. For example, for "if 2 + 2 == 4", the condition will be true because the expression "2 + 2 = 4" is true. 

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

"=" is used to assign value to a variable. For example, "x = 7" assigns the value 7 to the variable x. "==" is a relational operator that, used in conjunction with a conditional, checks for equality of values and evaluates whether the expression is true or false. For example, for the above "if 2 + 2 == 4", the "==" determines whether the value of "2 + 2" is equal to the value of "4".
