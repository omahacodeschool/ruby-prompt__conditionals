# What is a conditional?

 A conditional is what controls the flow of a program. A contional allows one to give a program conditions that, 
 when met, execute the program one way, or if not met, allow the program to run another way (for example, If, else, elseif, etc...).

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

"==" is used to check for equality, whereas "=" is used to set the value of variables.
