# What is a conditional?

A conditional asks a question to determine the state of being (true or false). 
It is used in a statement that will result in a specific output depending on the input. 

    Example: If I am hungry, then I will eat food, otherwise I will not eat food.

The 'am' acts as the conditional. 
The 'if', 'then', and 'otherwise(else)' are the instructions. 
Whether I am hungry or I am in any other state besides hungry is the input. 
The output is either that I will eat food or I will not eat food.

 
# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

The difference is that "==" is a question and "=" is an assignment.

"==" is used to determine whether something equals something else. Is beth's hunger level 10?

    if beth's hunger level == 10
     beth eats food
    else
     beth does not eat food
     
"=" is used to create or edit the quality of an object by taking what is on the right of the "=" and storing it in what is on the left of the "="
    
    a = "beth"

I'm storing the string "beth" inside the variable 'a'.
