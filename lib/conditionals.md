# What is a conditional?

A conditional statement allows a program to branch and behave differently based on whether an expression evaluates to equivalents to the boolean values "true" or "false".  Multiple types of conditions with different results may be chained together using if/elsif or case statements.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

In Ruby, a single equals sign is used to assign a variable to an object.  The double equals sign, '==', compares two values to see if they are equal.  If the two values are the same, it will return true. If they aren't, it returns false.
