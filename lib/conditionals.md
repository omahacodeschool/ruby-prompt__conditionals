# What is a conditional?

A conditional in programming is a good way to create variability in the program. "If" and "Elsif" statements are looking for something specific that is "true." Loops like "until" and "unless" might keep operating over a range of possible "true" inputs. Outside of programming, I was noticing that many if not all stories turn on what I guess we could call conditionals. 
It would be hard to tell an interesting story without them.
If you take the red pill, you enter The Matrix. Elsif you take the blue pill, you wake up in your bed.
Unless you can pull the sword Excalibur from the stone you are not the king.
Until the clock strikes midnight, Cinderella can stay at the royal ball. (I guess "until" is a loop.)
Without having done much programming, it seems to me I would use "if" and "elseif" pretty routinely. In my English-writing head, an "unless" statement seems clunky, like you are producing a double negative


# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

The way I see it, I would use "=" when I assign a value or meaning to something. It doesn't have to make sense anywhere except that program, like: FirstNumber = 7.
I would use "==" when I am asking the program to check whether the stuff on the left side of == equals the stuff on the right side.
