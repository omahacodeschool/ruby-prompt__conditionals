# What is a conditional?

A better definition for a conditional would be the part of the program that controls the flow of the execution of the program. When I mentioned that conditional statments begin as if statements I simply meant that the "if" statement marks the beginning of a conditional statement. The "if" statement is immediately followed by a condition that the system will determine as true or false. If the condition is true the code immediately following will be executed. Any code following the else statment will be executed if the statment is false. Elseif statments can also be included in order to create multiple conditions within a program that have separate outcomes. There are many cases where conditional statments can be used in a program such as determining if a user's input fits the parameters of the program or outputting separate statments depending on the user's input, or any situation where alternate paths are needed in a program.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A '=' is an assignment. Meaning that anything on the right of the '=' will be assigned to whatever is on the left. This is often used to assign variables. The '==' is a comparison. So in the example of a conditional, whatever is on the left will be compared to whatever is on the right and a True or False answer will be determined.
