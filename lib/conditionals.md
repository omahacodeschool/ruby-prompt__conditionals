# What is a conditional?

Being a visual thinker, I view conditionals as being gatekeepers which halt the progression of a program to ensure certain conditions are met, creating control flow.
These gatekeepers create conditions utilizing 'true' and 'false' in various constructs to evaluate statements. If the statement meets the requirements of the gatekeeper's construct, the program will move forward in one way or another.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

'=' is an assignment operator, meaning that '=' will assign the value of the operand on its left to the operand on its right.
Ex-- Four = 4
     puts Four
     
     4

'==' is a comparison operator, meaning that it asks, "is the operand on the left the same as the operand on the right?" and will evaluate to 'true' or 'false'.
Ex-- 4 == 4
     4 == 5
     
     true
     false
     
An example using both might look like:
Ex-- Four = 4
     puts Four == 4
     
     true
