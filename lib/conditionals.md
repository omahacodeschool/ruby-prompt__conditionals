# What is a conditional?

Conditional tells the program what part of the code to implement when a certain criteria is met.
An example would if x + 7 > 10 than display following text “The number is greater than 10” else if this statement is false to display “The number is less than 10”.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

The = sign is used set the value of a variable while the == checks if the two variables are equal or not, if yes then the condition becomes true.
