# What is a conditional?

A conditional is a programming statement that resolves to a true or false answer; examples of common operators used in conditional statements are the equal sign (=), plus sign (+), and the greater than (>) or less than (<) signs.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A single equal sign (=) is what you'd use in an assignment statement, or a statement where you're saying the object on the left side of the equal sign belongs to what is on the right side of the equal sign.

A double equal sign (==) is what you use in an evaluative statement to ask if something has a specific value in a conditional statement. 
Ex: "if a == 7 then b = 'Good'" says, "if a equals 7, then b equals the word 'Good'"
