# What is a conditional?

Conditionals are how a progrom decides what to do when it runs, based on a certain condition.
For example, in an if statement, the computer will decide if a statement is true or false. If the statement is true, the code will run.
If the statement is false, the program can continue to run by adding an else statement to the code. That way, the program can do something else if the statement is false.
If you want the program to run beyond one condition, then an elsif (else if) is used for as many conditions as you want.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A single equals sign (=) is used to set value to a variable in code. For example, I can make name = Nikki or dog = happy.
A double equals sign (==) checks for equality. For example, 2+3==5, which would be true!
