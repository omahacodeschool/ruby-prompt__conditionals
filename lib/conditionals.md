# What is a conditional?

Conditionals are the aspects of program that control the overall flow of it. 
This is observed via statements (if, elsif, else, while, unless). 
They basically set conditions that boil down true or false based on the value of a variable to complete a task

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

The difference between "=" and "==" is that "=" makes the variable on the left side of the
"=" equal to the parameter on the right side of "=" while "==" checks to see if both values are equal to one another.
