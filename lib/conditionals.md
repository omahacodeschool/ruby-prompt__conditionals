# What is a conditional?

    # conditionals are what control how the code will be ran by using if, elsif
    # and else statements. if and elsif will have conditions, if the conditon is met then
    # that part of the code will run, if the condition is not met, then that part of the code
    # will not be executed and it will move to the next elsif statement or the else statement.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

    # '=' is used to assign variables to objects: variable = objects, x = 3
    # '==' is used to determine if too objects or variables are equal, it 
    # compares the object on the left to the object on the right
