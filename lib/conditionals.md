# What is a conditional?

A conditional statement is one that allows the computer to run the same code until it runs into a circumstance that has been predefined 
afterwhich the command differs.  If I were programming a robot this would be a command something like:
Move forward
If unable to move forward 
Then turn left
Move forward

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

To me, these symbols seem to be linked similarly to similies and metaphors

= is for telling a variable to point at an object, kind of like a metaphor. 
She's a brick house
She = brick house

== still maintains that the two inputs are seperate but equal, such as a similie. 
We're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
We're glowing == the metal on the edge of a knife
