# What is a conditional?

A conditional is a piece of code that will only execute if a certain conditional statement is true.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

'=' assigns a value to a variable, while '==' is a conditional operator comparing two values and returning true if they are equal or false if they are not.
