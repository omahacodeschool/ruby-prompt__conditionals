# What is a conditional?

Conditionals are used when there is a situation where a true or false result given
some criteria. The user will specify a criteria and if it follows some defined 
condition in the code, the predefined result will be produced.

example 
scenario -> does my english make sense?(does_it?)
if does_it? = no
    puts then do some editting
if does_it? = yes 
    puts I lucked out!
end

My code relied on the scenario if I made sense or not. The solutions I, the coder,
defined were no and yes. The user would provide either a no or a yes where after
their response went through my code the result is displayed.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A single equality is used to define/assign a variable to a value. From my experience
whenever I need to loop a code a specific number of times, then I will use i = 0
to start and at the end of each completed loop the equation i = i + 1 will increase
i by 1.

A double equality is used when a true or false value is part of the code. Using 
the above scenario, if the needed number of loops is 10, then the block of code
running the loop will begin as if i == 10 then the code will stop, elseif the 
code will continue to loop.
