# What is a conditional?

A conditional is used to control the flow of a program once it is executed.  It does this by using 'if', 'else', and 'elseif' statements.  
If the condition following an 'if' statement is true, then Ruby will run the block of code following it.  If the statement is false, then Ruby will jump to 
the next line of code.  Often this is an 'else' statement.  We can add multiple conditions to the code using 'elseif'.  Like an 'if' statement, an 'elseif' statement
will run the following block of code only if the condition is true.  Otherwise, it will jump to the next 'elseif' or 'else' statement in the code. 


# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

In Ruby a '==' is used to check equality,
while '=' is used to set the value of a variable.
