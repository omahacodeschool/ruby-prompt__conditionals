# What is a conditional?

Conditionals basically control how a program is executed. In Ruby, you assign a variable a value, but then what are you going to do with it? That’s where flow control comes in. Flow control includes conditionals like if statements and elsif statements:

“if” a condition is met (through user input) do this…
“elsif” allows for additional condition(s) to be met (you can add as many of these as you want)
 “else” do this if condition(s) not met

Another example of control flow is "while" which creates loops. Basically, it's telling Ruby that "while" a condition is true, keep doing something, as opposed to a one-time operation like "if."

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

One equal sign (=) is what you use to assign an object (a string or an integer, for example) to a variable.

Two equals signs (==) check for actual equality. In our conditionals scenario, a program would be checking between a string in an if/elsif statement and a user’s input.
