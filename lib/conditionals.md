# What is a conditional?

A conditional establishes what should happen when the code incounters a specific input. For example, a conditional could say if name == shannon, then that person is great.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

In Ruby, '=' is a statement/assignment, and "==" is more of a question. '=' assigns a variable to a string (for example, my name = shannon) while '==' is asking if they are equal (for example, 1==1 will result in 'true' and 1==2 will usually result in false)
