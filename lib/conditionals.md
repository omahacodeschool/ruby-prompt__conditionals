# What is a conditional?

A conditional statement is one that allows the computer to run the same code until it runs into a circumstance that has been predefined 
afterwhich the command differs.  If I were programming a robot this would be a command something like:
Move forward. If unable to move forward, then turn left. Move forward.


# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

To me, these symbols seem to be linked similarly to similies and metaphors

= is for telling a variable to point at an object, kind of like a metaphor. 
She's a brick house.
She = brick house

== still maintains that the two inputs are seperate but equal, such as a similie. 
We're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife.
We're glowing == the metal on the edge of a knife

In ruby if we ran the code lion == bravery the result would be false. But if you assign them to equivalent 
variables such as lion=1 and bravery=3-2 then lion==bravery becomes true.
