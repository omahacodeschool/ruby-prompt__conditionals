# What is a conditional?

Conditionals are expressions that evaluate to either true or false. 
They are mostly used to determine Program Flow through if statements and while loops.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

= is for telling a variable to point
at an object (assignment), and == is for asking the question “Are these
two objects equal?”
